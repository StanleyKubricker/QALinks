{"https://www.qa-financial.com/articles/french-treasury-pioneers-new-open-source-data-management-platform": "More than 100 experts from financial firms met in Canary Wharf, London, on October 18th for the QA Financial Forum London. Among the expert speakers were Mohamed Mehdi Ben Aissa (pictured), and Sinh Chung Nguyen, data architects at the Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Finances Publiques (DGFiP) - the treasury department of the French state - who explained their role in the creation of a new open source data management platform.\r\n\r\nOver the past 18 months, DGFiP and  \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France, the French energy provider, have developed the Trunk Data Platform (TDP) -  a free and open source Apache-based distribution platform, with its source code readily available on GitHub.  \r\n\r\nThe decision to create this new platform followed the acquisition of the open-source Hortonworks data platform by Cloudera in early 2019. This - according to the DGFiP -  fundamentally changed the dynamics of the data management marketplace, and it decided to move to its own new platform,\r\n\r\nPreviously using HDP 3.1.4, DGFiP found the need to move away from the platform when it was acquired by Cloudera in early 2019, as it became deprecated for Cloudera\u2019s own offerings. Wanting to avoid vendor lock-in, and with a strong open-source philosophy at the treasury, DGFiP and other French public and private bodies, including EDF, discussed alternative approaches to open source data management.\r\n\r\nAt the QA Financial Forum Ben Aissa described the key uses for data management: for fraud detection, electronic invoicing, and also the Foncier Innovant, a scheme which includes a series of innovative technologies, which  has recently been used, for example, to find untaxed swimming pools with an AI cross-referencing satellite data.\r\n\r\nBy adopting what the DGFiP architects describe as a \u2018data stewardship model\u2019, the platform is intended to make sharing data easier, while improving the quality of the data and cutting down on duplicate work. Now they are seeking to develop the user interface of the platform, introduce Kubernetes integration, alongside monitoring and log management, and deepen its machine learning integrations.", "https://www.qa-financial.com/articles/introducing-the-qa-financial-100": "The QA Financial 100 is a complete and detailed directory of the industry leaders in test automation and other DevOps technologies and will be a key resource for heads of software engineering and QA.\r\nIn this 40-page guide - available as a downloadable PDF - we have produced comprehensive profiles on the 100 leading vendors of software quality management services, detailing the tools they offer and their core business focus, along with details of recent corporate activity, including M&A activity, ownership changes and major new PE and VC investments.

Why should I speak at the QA Financial Forum?\r\n\r\nThere is a real value to discussing how your firm and your team are addressing the challenge of managing software quality in its digital transformation.\u00a0You\u2019ll be discussing and networking with peers from other financial firms who are interested in what you are doing, and sharing their experiences with you.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncreasingly, financial firms are sharing information on software management as regulators and supervisors seek to establish industry standards for digital resilience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, why not celebrate your achievements and the challenges you have overcome?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.) How do we agree on a topic?\r\n\r\nWe will discuss that with you and - based on that discussion - provide you with a draft description for your approval. We aim to minimise the amount of work you have to do on this, and guide you on the information points that your audience will be most interested in.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe know you have an interesting story to tell, and we\u2019ll help you tell it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. ) Who are the delegates at your Forum events?\r\n\r\nAll our delegates are invited. They are senior IT professionals at banks, insurers, asset managers and capital market firms. Typically, we have around 100 delegates at our events, and we leave plenty of time for coffee and lunch breaks for networking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.) Where do the Forums take place?\r\n\r\nWe use venues at the heart of financial centers that are easy for delegates and speakers to access, such as the Harvard Club of New York on W44th St in NYC. Our venues always offer high levels of audio-visual equipment and catering service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.) How do I address my firm\u2019s internal compliance process?\r\n\r\nWe find that compliance and communications departments typically ask the same key questions. And here are the answers:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe producer of the QA Financial Forum series is QA Media, an independent, privately-owned, information business based in London.\r\n\r\nQA Media has an information focus on technologies for software quality assurance and our website is\u00a0www.qa-financial.com\r\n\r\nThe audience at the Forum events are invited delegates from financial and E-commerce firms.\r\n\r\nThe speakers are prominent software QA and IT risk managers.\r\n\r\nThe Forums run in London, NYC, Chicago, Stockholm, Milan, Paris and Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe events are \"Chatham House Rule\" and treated as background only by delegates as a condition of invitation.\r\n\r\nNo media are in attendance.\r\n\r\nAround 100 delegates attend the events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n6.) Do you have any useful guidelines for speakers?\r\n\r\nYes.\u00a0Our presentations all last 30 minutes, including some time for audience questions. That time flies by, so above all focus your session on a topic of clear relevance, including examples of best practice where possible.\r\n\r\nNot all our presentations are simply PowerPoint presentations. They can take the form of panel sessions, or Q&A sessions. But slides that illustrate key points are always useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if you are - like most speakers - presenting on your own, then typically 10-12 slides is an optimum number. We suggest a font size of no less than 14 for the text, and clear fonts, such as Sans Serifs. Remember please that small charts or graphs that cannot be read by delegates will be frustrating for them.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll ask you to supply the presentation in advance so we can load it onto the AV system and the conference room will be equipped with a laptop, slide-changer etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7.) Who do I get in touch with?\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in discussing the idea of speaking at one of our events, please drop a line to Karine Hetherington, our conference producer, at\u00a0karine@qa-financial.com.

The aim is to offer a unified testing environment, enabling enterprises to optimise users\u2019 digital experience.\r\n \r\nFounded in 2017, LambdaTest claims over two million users for its range of testing platforms, which support all major programming languages and test automation frameworks.\r\n\r\nLambdaTest\u2019s Digital Experience Testing Cloud is designed to allow customers to perform cross browser testing, real device testing, continuous testing, and visual regression testing and will provide detailed analytics and insights to facilitate data-driven decision-making, the company says.  \r\n\r\nLambdaTest was recently name-checked by Microsoft chairman and CEO Satya Nadella (pictured), who earlier this year told a Microsoft conference in Bengaluru that: \u201cLambdaTest is doing for test automation what Kubernetes did for container orchestration - creating that next level of efficiency around test automation so that people can actually focus on testing versus test orchestration\u201d.", "https://www.qa-financial.com/articles/m-a-in-software-testing-outpaces-broader-it-sector": "It\u2019s been a busy year for merger activity among quality assurance and testing firms. According to research by Capstone Partners, a private equity firm, the number of mergers among software development firms in the first half of 2022 was up 27% on the number in 2021 - faster growth than in the broader technology sector. Deals are being driven by the need to keep pace with demand for upgrading legacy systems and migration to the Cloud. Demand for containerization, AI, and security technologies is likely to underpin this trend into 2023, according to Capstone.\r\nThe largest acquisition of the year among testing specialists is almost certain to be OpenText\u2019s $6bn bid for Micro Focus, announced in August. Founded in 1976, Micro Focus has a long history in software test automation, although its share price was under significant pressure prior to bid, having falled by 37% since the start of the year. The share price doubled on the news of the agreed offer..\r\nIn February, Tricentis, the test automation firm that has competed most directly with Micro Focus over recent years, acquired Testim, a AI-based platform for UI testing. \r\nMay saw three acquisitions: Hexawise, the low-code software test automation tool was acquired by Idera, a leading software company headquartered in Texas; Perforce, parent company of test automation platform Perfecto, completed its acquisition of Puppet, the provider of cloud infrastructure automation, and Planview, a Texan portfolio management company, acquired Tasktop, the Canadian value stream management platform.\r\nIn August Level Access, the digital accessibility testing company completed its merger with eSSENTIAL Accessibility, which offers accessibility as a service, and Qualitest acquired Indian software testing company ZenQ, adding over 600 quality engineers to its team. \r\n\r\nMore detail on the activities of vendors in 2022 can be found in the QA Financial 100.\r\nMost recently, Planit, the Australia-based test automation specialist, announced in early November that it will acquire Shift Left Group, a quality assurance management company based in the UK, following its strategy to become the largest specialist quality engineering service provider worldwide by 2030 through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions across the UK, Europe, and Asia. Planit also acquired New Zealand-based QA integration company Qual IT in July.", "https://www.qa-financial.com/articles/tricentis-launches-cloud-based-no-code-testing": "Tricentis, the Austria-based test automation specialist, has released Tricentis Test Automation (TTA),  a cloud-based no-code test automation solution. The platform includes test creation, orchestration, and scalable test execution for web-based applications and business processes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhile organisations are building their businesses and deploying applications on the cloud, most teams are constrained by legacy processes which are creating slow, error-prone and costly challenges due to the lack of a viable cloud-based testing solution,\u201d said Suhail Ansari, CTO of Tricentis (pictured). \u201cTricentis Test Automation enables organisations to automate end-to-end quality for their integrated cloud-based solutions with faster speeds, no-code, and reduced test maintenance costs.\u201d\r\n\r\nTricentis described the SaaS-based solution as \u201cthe next iteration of model-based testing\u201d, built specifically for enterprise applications where use cases or business processes span multiple applications. TTA builds on the processes used in Tosca, Tricentis\u2019 flagship offering, which also provides model-based no-code test automation tools, but is specialised for cloud-based applications, enabling teams to verify quality across their integrated platforms. \r\n\r\nFrom functional UI to API/microservices testing, by way of a no-code interface, the solution allows anyone to quickly assemble scalable automated tests without coding or prior test automation knowledge, Tricentis said.\r\n\r\nTTA\u2019s key features include end-to-end process testing, suitable for cloud-based SaaS services, utilising the elastic execution grid (E2G) to test at scale by running multiple tests in parallel across distributed infrastructures and virtual machines.\r\n\r\nThrough model-based UI test automation, the underlying application is kept separate, which Tricentis says allows for flexible and resilient testing. By simulating microservices that are out of a team\u2019s control, costly, or unavailable, applications can be tested earlier and more completely. Virtual services and contract tests are created from recorded traffic and deployed as needed in the DevOps process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Image source: Tricentis]", "https://www.qa-financial.com/articles/skandia-trials-new-data-test-management-platform": "Skandia, the leading Swedish-based insurance company, is trialling a new test-data management platform launched in 2020.\r\n\r\nSkandia is using X-AutoMate\u2019s new framework for data quality management and test automation for its solvency reporting application.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe possibility to follow up on test approaches instead of test cases increase the possibility to communicate with stakeholders on what QA improvements are needed, for example what is covered on what test level,\u201d said an employee at Skandia.\r\n\r\nFounded in Sweden in 2020, X-AutoMate launched its testing platform in 2021. The platform includes a library of 35 methodologies for analysing data flows. Based on open-source tools, the platform is technology agnostic, X-AutoMate claims, and is able to connect to data lakes on-prem, in the cloud, via VM or Kubernetes container. The platform includes two modules, offering test automation for data sources alongside simple data quality management.\r\n\r\nBy analysing the metadata of the sources, the testing framework defines test cases without observing data directly. This helps to minimise the security concerns and scalability issues involved with large data sets. \r\n\r\nKnow-your-customer (KYC) requirements at financial firms require high quality data, which can be difficult to acquire when environments become complex. Outcomes at one data source must be echoed throughout the data warehouse. By completing checks on data across the warehouse, X-AutoMate limits siloing and pushes the errors found in the warehouse left in the development cycle.\r\n\r\nWhile most data quality management tools observe production data, X-AutoMate\u2019s testing tool monitors the development pipeline and halts deployment before issues enter production, avoiding the slow and expensive process of patching large amounts of live data.\r\n\r\nThe tooling for test data compliance often lags behind other QA and development environments at financial firms. With the ability to verify and catalogue the complete data flow, including the semantic layers, X-AutoMate will replace more limited reporting tools, claims its head of product development, Bernes Maksumic (pictured).\r\n\r\nSo, for example, Skandia\u2019s use of X-AutoMate for its Solvency reporting application, a complex system that took inputs from many ledgers, helps to meet the demand from regulators for strict standards for calculations and transformations made across multiple layers of data, so that  outputs can be validated.", "https://www.qa-financial.com/articles/ransomware-attacks-on-financial-firms-increase-300-": "Research by California-based  IT security specialist Barracuda has revealed that financial firms have seen ransomware attacks this year rise to a level as much as three times higher than they were 12 months previously. The increase in working-from-home is one key reason for the increase, Barracuda says in a research report.\r\n\r\nThe research  also noted a rise in the number of attacks on IT and business service providers. These attacks are especially dangerous as they can offer unique access to clients\u2019 systems, and outages can have dramatic knock-on effects across a number of clients.\r\n\r\nBased on data gathered on its clients via its  security operations centre,  Barracuda detected a peak of 1.2 million attempts for the month of June. The key channels of attack were through the use of phishing links and gaining access to less secure VPNs, a method which has gained in popularity as a result of remote working, according to Barracuda. Although firms have had time to improve their authentication methods since the start of the Covid pandemic, it remains to be seen if the upward trend will continue.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs ransomware and other cyberthreats continue to evolve, the need for adequate security solutions has never been greater,\u201d said Fleming Shi, CTO at Barracuda. \u201cSophisticated security technologies should be available as services, so that businesses of all sizes can protect themselves against these ever-changing threats.\u201d\r\n\r\nOf the 106 highly-publicised ransomware attacks since August 2021, the financial sector accounted for 6% of attacks.The most targeted industries were education (15%), municipalities (12%) and healthcare (12%). Attacks on critical infrastructure, such as energy and water companies, saw the highest relative increase in the same period. \r\n\r\nThe Barracuda report underlines that most successful attacks are not publicly disclosed.

This review captures some of the most interesting recent venture capital funding rounds - including completed deals for accessibility testing specialist Evinced, mobile app tester Mobot and low-code platform Retool.\r\n\r\nAccessibility testing has become increasingly important because of the requirement under the US Americans with Disabilities Act that websites are treated as public spaces, and therefore must not discriminate against customers with disabilities.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an industry organisation, is close to announcing version 2.2 of its international Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). WCAG 2.2 is expected to become a \u201cCandidate Recommendation\u201d by September 2022, according to the W3C, meaning it has met consensus and satisfies technical requirements for full adoption for adoption later this year. The largest change from 2.1 includes adding accessible authentication steps around multi factor authentication and the explicit allowance for mechanisms like password managers.\r\n\r\nAccessibility specialist Evinced raised $38m in a series B funding in June, led by Insight Venture Partners. Evinced was founded in 2018 by Navin R. Thadani and Gal Moav, two former Oracle executives based in Palo Alto and Israel respectively. Evinced launched its web and mobile accessibility testing solutions in 2021. The platforms scan user flows to identify problems for screen readers and keyboard-reliant users (those who cannot use mice alongside their keyboard) through the use of a system of advanced code analysis, which Evinced claims can catch problems overlooked by static syntax checks.\r\n\r\nAnother accessibility testing firm, Stark has recently secured a $6m seed led by Uncork Capita and yet another, Assistiv Labs, raised a $1m pre-seed led by Zenda Capital.\r\n\r\nMobile app testing firms have seen demand boosted by the Covd pandemic. New York-based Mobot claims to be unique in its testing process, using robots to physically test applications on real mobile devices. Mobot says its platform can enable the automation of tests that cannot be completed by emulators. In August, Mobot completed its series A funding round of $12.5m, led by Cota Capital.\r\n\r\nSofy, a no-code mobile test automation platform, received $7.75 in seed funding, led by Voyager Capital. Founded in 2016 and headquartered in Washington state, Sofy enables manual and no-code automated testing of mobile apps and websites.\r\n\r\nTwo firms specialising in low-code development tools have also raised funding.One is Retool, which uses a base of 90 development components to allow for the quick construction of internal applications. CEO and co-founder David Hsu described this process as being able to cut coding down to: \u201cthe last 20% or 30%\u201d of the work on any project.\r\n\r\n\u201cRetool sits at the intersection of two major trends: the rise of the developer and the increasing importance of operational excellence after a pandemic that compressed a decade of digital transformation into two years,\u201d said Bryan Schreier, a partner at Sequoia Capital, the firm leading the $45m series C investment.\r\n\r\nFounded in 2021, Superblocks provides the building blocks for quickly spinning up internal tools and APIs, utilising a library of popular components to reduce the need for skills in languages such as React, HTML or CSS. Superblocks completed $37m in funding from Kleiner Perkins, Greenoaks, Spark and Meritech in mid-August.\r\n\r\nOther recent investments include Cloud optimiser, Sync Computing, landing $12m in funding led by Costanoa Ventures, and Massdriver, a cloud architecture platform for DevOps receiving a $4m seed from Y Combinator.\r\n\r\nFirm\tRound\tAmount\tDate\tFirm Type\r\nMassdriver\tSeed\t$4m\t19 August\tCloud architecture for DevOps\r\nSofy\tSeed\t$7.75\t17 August\tNo-code mobile test automation\r\nSync Computing\t -\t$15.5m\t16 August\tCloud optimisation\r\nMobot \tSeries A\t$12.5m\t15 August\tMobile testing\r\nSuperblocks\t -\t$37m\t11 August\tLow-code internal tools\r\nStark\tSeed\t$6m\t10 August\tAccessibility testing\r\nRetool Inc \tSeries C\t$45m\t28 July\tLow-code internal tools\r\nAssistiv Labs\tPreseed\t$1m\t13 July\tAccessibility testing\r\nEvinced\tSeries B\t$38m\t23 June\tAccessibility testing", "https://www.qa-financial.com/articles/exactpro-testing-smooths-wealthos-release": "WealthOS, a cloud-native SaaS platform for digital wealth management operating systems, has been released as a freely available sandbox environment.

Our research found that three elements are critical to success: test service virtualization, test data preparation, and an effective integration between micro-services and components.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut while achieving these goals is one challenge; proving their benefits with clear benchmarks is another. For this, our research drew on data compiled by QA Vector Analytics from 20 leading financial firms, which benchmarks the effectiveness of those firms\u2019 software quality management processes. (You can read more about QA Vector Analytics here.)\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe then took a deep-dive with Bank of America and ING into some of the specific quality assurance challenges they are facing as they continue their transition to continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), and why they are looking to service virtualization and Parasoft to accelerate that transformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProviding on-demand test environments for complex interfaces between services was previously a bottleneck for ING, for example. Simplifying the service environment with the support of Parasoft Virtualize allowed ING to create credible test environments for its teams and containerized versions for vendors whenever required, said Raymond Smit, IT Chapter Lead at ING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was always very difficult to do your tests on time. We simulated the test environments in a simple way, but it\u2019s not the live situation. We came to Virtualize so we could record the behavior of each interface and have a stable test environment\u201d said Smit, in an online interview you can see here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe transition from monolithic services to chains of microservices makes test data generation another complex challenge. According to Istiak Ahmed, SVP and Software Quality Assurance Manager, at Bank of America, this requires a deep understanding of upstream data filtration - if data is selected manually.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Bank of America switched to test virtualization, the time spent on test data management was reduced by 50%, said Istiak Ahmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur research paper also covers other bottlenecks common to release management; for example the typical requirements for UI testing, which often force teams to wait until development is complete, creating tests that are volatile and difficult to maintain.

The cause was found to be insufficient testing, where misconfigurations and infrastructure changes left gaps in defences that could have been caught by a continuous testing method.\r\n\r\nThe advisory, titled - \u2018Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Affiliated Cyber Actors Exploiting Vulnerabilities for Data Extortion and Disk Encryption for Ransom Operations\u2019 -  is a response to attacks linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards, which the CISA describes as \u2018a driving force behind Iranian state-sponsored cyberattacks\u2019. It details the techniques used in attacks, highlighting VMware Horizon Log4j vulnerabilities for initial access and ongoing use of known Fortinet and Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities. \r\n\r\n\u201cAfter gaining access to a network, these actors likely determine a course of action based on their perceived value of the data, including data encryption or exfiltration for ransom operations,\u201d the advisory reads.\r\n\r\nIranian state-linked actors were condemned last week for a series of attacks against Albanian government infrastructure in July, leading to the destruction of data and disruption of government functions. Three Iranian nationals were also recently charged with hacking hundreds of companies in the US, accused of ransomware attacks on infrastructure since October 2020.", "https://www.qa-financial.com/articles/ai-banks-should-take-it-steady-advises-occ": "Banks should innovate with AI with caution, and should involve risk professionals in their innovation planning, said the head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) at a recent risk and compliance conference in Seattle, hosted by the American Bankers Association.\r\n\r\nActing comptroller of the currency Michael J. Hsu [pictured] began by identifying AI and tokenization as: \u201cTwo innovations that are evolving quickly and have the potential to be highly impactful on banking\u201d, before going on to highlight risks involved. Aligning AI systems with their design goals is a core challenge, he said.\r\n\r\n \u201cAI systems, which are generally based on neural networks, are not programmed explicitly like most software. They require training, and their outputs are not predictable. While this is part of their magic, it also creates a fundamental problem: since AI systems are built to \u2018learn\u2019, they may or may not do what we want or behave consistent with our values. This alignment problem is inherent to all AI systems and is the focus of intense research.\u201d\r\n\r\nHsu went on to outline key regulatory principles for regulating AI innovation:\r\n\r\nInnovate in stages: \u201cInnovating in stages requires discipline. The concept is simple: start with what can be controlled, expand only when ready, monitor carefully, adjust, and repeat.\u201d\r\n\r\nBuild the brakes while building the engine: \u201cRisk and compliance professionals need to be at the innovation table and have their voices heard. In the technology space, speed to market is an important factor in innovation. Slowing things down is seen as anti-innovative. Structurally and culturally, this casts the risk and compliance functions as barriers to innovation.\u201d\r\n\r\nEngage regulators early and often. Hsu said this can be achieved by: \u201cGiving risk and compliance professionals a seat at the innovation table from the get-go and heeding their input. Empowering them to identify risks and risk mitigants will help ensure that the products and services that result will be safe, sound, fair, and trusted\u201d. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Hsu referenced the OCC\u2019s new Office of Financial Technology. \u201cRegulators, of course, must be responsive, knowledgeable, and agile. This is why we recently expanded and upgraded our Office of Innovation to the Office of Financial Technology and hired a Chief Financial Technology Officer. Building a bigger and stronger team fluent in both financial technology and bank supervision will allow us to keep up with developments more easily, to engage banks and fintechs more actively, to educate examiners and policy staff more effectively, and to collaborate with peer agencies more regularly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n[Image Source: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]", "https://www.qa-financial.com/articles/alten-group-acquires-qa-consultants": "Alten Group, the France-based Engineering and IT services company, has acquired Toronto-headquartered software quality engineering services company QA consultants. \r\n\r\nSpeaking about the deal, Alten Group chairman and CEO Simon Azoulay(pictured)  said: \u201cQA Consultants has established itself as a leader in software quality engineering, and this acquisition allows us to enhance our service offering across all industries and sectors with even more robust end-to-end software development services\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe deal, in which Alten Group will acquire all of the assets of QA Consultants for an undisclosed sum, will see QA Consultants continue business as usual and operate as an independent subsidiary.\r\n\r\n[Image Source: Alten Group]", "https://www.qa-financial.com/articles/attacks-highlight-software-supply-chain-risks": "A report published by Synopsys, the US-based code quality management vendor, indicates a growing awareness of software supply chain risks among firms. Firms are increasingly using software bills of materials (SBOMs), which describe the components of software, to mitigate those risks, the survey found. SBOMs make it easier to find and avoid vulnerable components, and are especially relevant to the management of open-source software, the report says. \r\n\r\nIncreasing automated software testing and DevSecOps practices are also identified as key trends in software security management in Synopys\u2019s Building Security in Maturity Model (BSIMM) report, which has been published annually since 2008. \r\n\r\nAccording to the BSIMM report there has been a 30% increase in the building and maintaining SBOMs to catalogue the components within deployed software over the past 12 months and  a 51% increase in activities associated with controlling open source risks.\r\n\r\n\"The BSIMM13 findings suggest that with the attention placed on software supply chains, most enterprise organisations are taking a risk-based approach to application security,\u201d said Jason Schmitt, general manager of the Synopsys Software Integrity Group. \u201cSuch an approach recognizes that security isn't limited to the codebase; it includes the process of software development where security reviews and testing 'shift everywhere' to continuously improve security outcomes.\" \r\n\r\n\"The findings also demonstrate that BSIMM member organisations' software security initiatives are maturing, and they're now looking for ways to drive the scalability, efficiency and overall effectiveness of their programs,\" Schmitt said.\r\n\r\nHowever, some analysts say SBOMs do not protect against common attacks, such as Log4j, which capitalise on the perceived security of an SBOM-based approach. For example, OX Security, the Israeli end-to-end software supply chain security platform for DevSecOps,  aims to address this problem with a new standard: the \u2018pipeline bill of materials\u2019; designed to dynamically map attack surfaces, from source code to containers and pipelines. Last week OX Security announced completion of a $34m seed financing round.\r\n\r\nRegulators are looking more closely at the issue of security for software supply chains. They recently highlighted the risk and recommended test automation to cover vulnerabilities. \r\n\r\nAnd while the Synopsys report on supply chain risk highlights improvements, not all research is so optimistic. A survey of C-suite executives in the US and Euriope released by CloudBees, the California-based DevOps platform, revealed a drop in confidence for perceived software supply chain security as firms get to grips with the true size of the challenge. While 88% of executives say their software supply chain is secure or very secure, that is a decline from 95% in 2021.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe fall in confidence for perceived security levels reflects that executives are starting to accept the reality of the depth and breadth of security and compliance challenges that their companies are facing,\u201d said Prakash Sethuraman, chief information security officer of CloudBees (pictured). \u201cThere seems to be more of an understanding that supply chain security is a challenge that needs to be taken seriously and is perhaps far more complex than was originally understood by senior management.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe CloudBees survey found 59% of executives believe their software supply chain is almost or completely automated, dropping 16% from 2021, while 78% say their software supply chain is mostly or completely compliant, dropping from 90% from the previous year. \r\n\r\nIn countries that reported lower levels of software supply chain and compliance automation, shifting security and compliance left was seen as a help to development teams, while in countries like the USA, UK, and Australia - where automation is high - shifting security and compliance left was seen as a burden, increasing time spent auditing. Three quarters of executives say that compliance and security challenges are hindering innovation.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhile shift left is a popular talking point, it is not yielding the desired results. Instead, it is further burdening development teams and taking their attention away from value-added work\u201d, Sethuraman said. \u201cWhat\u2019s needed is a new mindset and a fresh approach, one in which security and compliance are continuous and actually speed innovation.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt the end of September, Cloudbees announced the acquisition of ReleaseIQ - the Californian DevSecOps platform - to expand its own CI/CD and DevSecOps offerings.", "https://www.qa-financial.com/articles/whitepaper-banking-finance-": "WhitePaper: Banking & Finance", "https://www.qa-financial.com/articles/esprow-launches-fix-api-solution": "Esprow, the test and compliance automation specialist,has launched a new API management tool as part of its Enterprise Testing Platform (ETP) for the Financial Information eXchange (FIX) trading system.\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the new FIX Orchestra technology standard defined by the FIX Trading community, S-Box is designed to act as a central repository for creating, browsing, managing, sharing, and exporting specifications for both FIX and non-FIX protocols.\r\n\r\n\u201cAPI management is becoming increasingly important as more organisations rely on APIs to drive their digital transformation efforts,\u201d said Francesco Lo Conte, CEO of Esprow (pictured). \u201cWith ETP S-Box, we\u2019re making it easier for companies to manage their FIX APIs, so they can focus on delivering value to their customers.\u201d\r\n\r\nS-Box features include: the ability to create and manage APIs, support for a variety of exchange protocols such as FIX, text, and binary, exporting and editing for dictionaries and documentation, and the generation of API specifications from production log files. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, ETP S-Box offers a REST API for exporting XML-based message specifications programmatically into other systems, including FIX engines and exchange line handlers. \r\n\r\nETP S-Box also integrates within FIX trading gateways and CI/CD pipelines and offers role-based access control for added security.\r\n\r\nIntegrating with Esprow\u2019s ETP Studio and ETP C-Box for automated testing and onboarding, S-Box can be deployed on-premises or to the Cloud.

These changes often break most automation cases, introducing extensive maintenance without the assistance of self-healing tools. \r\n\r\nTypically, DevOps engineers use AI-augmented testing in the form of self healing test cases (cited by 49% of survey respondents who said they were using AI) and also to identify or focus on high risk testing projects (cited by 44%). Functional testing was cited by 65% as especially well-suited to AI-augmented DevOps, followed by UI and performance testing. \r\n\r\nImproved customer experience and the reduction of the \u201cDevOps skills gap\u201d - making it easier for less-experienced engineers to automate testing - were seen as the two key business benefits of investment in AI-augmentation for DevOps.

These are:\r\n\r\nMobilise collective action to build a safe and responsible AI ecosystem: \u201cBack in 2018, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) developed the Fairness, Ethics, Accountability, Transparency (or FEAT for short) principles with the financial industry, to provide guidance on the responsible use of AI by financial institutions. This work was continued through the Veritas Consortium, involving 31 industry players, to translate and operationalise these principles. With the benefit of iterations and road-testing over the past few years, the consortium will now release a Veritas Toolkit 2.0, to support financial institutions in integrating the FEAT principles into their internal risk governance.\u201d \r\n(full article on Veritas Toolkit 2.0 available here)\r\n\r\nExamining the risks and opportunities of GenAI for the financial sector, under the new Project MindForge: \u201cThis project will bring the data resources and domain expertise of the banking sector, together with the top AI companies\u2019 state-of-the-art technologies and advanced algorithms.

By adopting a spirit of open-source sharing and creation, we hope that this platform can enable: Individuals to tap on available data to demonstrate their skills and solutions, and land a role within the financial sector; Smaller enterprises to level up their capabilities and gain confidence to explore new possibilities; and FinTechs and financial institutions to showcase their market-ready solutions to clinch business opportunities and funding.\u201d\r\n\r\nFull details available here\r\n\r\nUK to host first global AI summit\r\n\r\nThe British government has announced that it will host the first global AI summit this autumn.

The concept of \u2018Software 2.0\u2019, where code is written and abstracted by neural networks, has raised fears that programmers will become obsolete. However, coding assistants and no-code solutions have existed since at least 2013 and they have not taken over coding yet.\r\n\r\nCoding assistants seek to improve developer productivity by completing lines of code, or even predicting whole functions, based on the context and syntax of their environment. The idea is that less time is spent reading documentation when using unfamiliar frameworks or languages.\r\n\r\nKite and TabNine led the first generation of coding assistants. Their early predictions solely focused on completing lines of code. With constant evolution since their releases in 2014 and 2017, these older assistants have grown to support many languages and integrated development environments, using more elaborate models to predict complex code. There are now more than a dozen AI coding assistants generally available.\r\n\r\nGitHub released Copilot, its next-generation coding assistant, based on the neural networking model OpenAI Codex, a descendant of GPT-3, at the end of June. Copilot is trained on a range of source code, including public GitHub repositories. GitHub says Copilot allows developers to skip over writing boilerplate code, using prior context or plain English comments to determine the required functionality.\r\n\r\nShortly after Copilot was made available to individual developers, Amazon launched the preview round of its competitor, CodeWhisperer. Utilising its inherent links to the AWS Cloud, CodeWhisperer is able to determine which cloud services and public libraries are best suited to the code. Building on Amazon\u2019s CodeGuru and DevOpsGuru, CodeWhisperer is set to introduce security scans into the process.\r\n\r\nGitHub admits that Copilot is not yet perfect. While able to autocomplete lines of code, functions, and their supporting tests, Copilot suggestions are only accepted by users around 26% of the time, according to GitHub\u2019s own metrics. \r\n\r\nResearch by a team at the NYU Centre for Cybersecurity completed in 2021 found 40% of the code generated by Copilot contained security vulnerabilities resulting from bugs inherent in training from open-source repositories.\r\n\r\nOther concerns have been raised by Software Freedom Conservancy, a technology ethics nonprofit, around the risk of low-code platforms such as Copilot reusing code from open-source projects. CodeWhisperer is set to include information on how closely snippets match training data to let users avoid this.\r\n\r\nBut competition in the marketplace for low-code development tools will continue to grow. Another launch on the horizon is AlphaCode, designed by Alphabet-backed DeepMind. AlphaCode is claimed by its creators to perform better than the OpenAI Codex, the basis for Copilot. Unveiled in February for competitive programming, AlphaCode does not have a release date as a coding assistant, however.", "https://www.qa-financial.com/articles/hong-kong-regulator-urges-better-testing-for-payments-": "A letter to financial firms from Raymond Chan, Executive Director of Banking Supervision at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, has laid out a series of practices for improving operational resilience following \u201ca few payment-related operational incidents\u201d reported over the past year.\r\n\r\nThe incidents were most often caused by IT system malfunctions and led to the failures at firms to process payments within regulated cut-off times, the letter said.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe HKMA would like to remind [authorised institutions] of the importance of maintaining high operational resilience with respect to their payment operations,\u201d Chan said.
